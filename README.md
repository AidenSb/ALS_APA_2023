# "Single-nucleus Multiomic Atlas of Frontal Cortex in ALS: A Deep Learning Approach"

This repository is dedicated to reproducing results from the paper:

> "Single-nucleus Multiomic Atlas of Frontal Cortex in Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis with a Deep Learning-based Decoding of Alternative Polyadenylation Mechanisms" by Paul M. Mckeever and Aiden M. Sababi (2023).

The paper presents a comprehensive analysis of single-nucleus multiomics in the context of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), focusing on alternative polyadenylation mechanisms using deep learning techniques.

The primary objective of this repository is to provide codes and notebooks to replicate key figures and findings from the study, providing a transparent and reproducible path for validation and further exploration.
